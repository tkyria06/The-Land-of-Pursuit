## Game Story Summary

Land of Pursuit: is a racing-survival game where you find yourself in a supercar trying to escape from the terrorists where you are chased in a secluded village. The enemy is trying to kill you by throwing missiles from a helicopter. It is a matter of life and death and that is why you must run fast with no hesitation. The longer you stay alive, the more points you earn. Along the way you will find in front of you various categories of PowerUps where will help you to survive longer and earn more points. As time goes on and you stay alive, you level up. Thus, the missiles fired by your enemies will do more damage to you.
